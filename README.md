# What is this

A collection of simple sorting/searching algorithms implemented in C.

## Update (AUG 2020)

I will be revisiting this repo and creating a far more diverse list of algorithms, so stay tuned.

Oh and I will try and copy each algorithm I make in C and make a JS implementation because I enjoy JS and it finally is gaining the 
recognition it deserves.
